# 🥫 Pantry Planner – Receipt Scanner (v1.0)

This app serves as the foundation for a larger project called **Pantry Planner**, built with **Vue.js** (frontend) and **Python** (backend). Its main purpose is to help people **eat healthier** and **save money** based on their grocery receipts.

Using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), the app will extract item and price data from scanned grocery receipts. This data will be used to:
- Recommend healthy meals based on what was purchased
- Provide summaries and insights into a user's grocery spending habits
