Description: This App serves as the foundation for a bigger effort called "Pantry Planner". The main purpose is to help people eat healthier and save money from their shopping experience. This will be achieved using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to abstract item and price data from a grocery receipt. This data will then be used to help create and recommend healthy meals for a user, as well as help a user summarize their spending habits.
